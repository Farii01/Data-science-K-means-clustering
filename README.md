# K-means-clustering
R programming language is used to analyze the BreastCancer dataset. It starts by preparing the data, removing missing values, and converting the columns to numeric format. Then, it performs k-means clustering to identify groups or clusters within the data. The optimal number of clusters is determined using an elbow plot. The resulting clusters are visualized using scatter plots and analyzed to understand their characteristics. Additionally, the code performs variable clustering analysis to identify important variables. The relationships between variables and clusters are visualized using a heatmap. Overall, the code helps in understanding patterns and relationships in the BreastCancer dataset through clustering and visualization techniques.
